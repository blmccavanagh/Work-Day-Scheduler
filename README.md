# Work Day Scheduler

## This Github repository contains the code for a work day scheduler...
*insert more here*

I was motivated to develop this website to serve as a resource a user can utilize to test their knowledge of JavaScript. Developing the website also allowed me to apply my developing JavaScript language skills and understanding of web APIs in a real world application. 

I aim to continue to develop this website to include a broader range of questions to allow the user to test their knowledge further. A way in which this website could be enhanced would be to include multiple quizzes at varying difficulty levels or to add quizzes on varying topics such as HTML, CSS, jQuery etc.

In developing this website I challenged myself by developing the application using javascript and web APIs.

I chose to build the quiz using JavaScript for several reasons. One of the main reasons was so that editing the quiz in the future would be easier. Storing the questions in an array means that adding to that array in future developments is simple and time effective. Storing the questions in an array also offers the ability to randomise the questions should I want to.

I ensured the website had a responsive design, allowing it to adapt itself to different devices and screen sizes. I worked to create a CSS based layout that was optimised for both desktop and mobile based view.

In order to make the website stand out from my peers I had a particular focus on aesthetics and layout, with the goal of having a website that was pleasing to the eye, easy to navigate and consistent in its application of style and graphics to enhance the UI while also challenging the user effectively to help them develop their skills and knowledge of web development, specifically JavaScript. I also worked to incorporate aspects of my personal brand, so that the website looks consistent within my application portfolio, creating a cohesive brand across my deployed web pages.
